# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Overview
Customer churn directly impacts business revenue and growth. This project aims to identify key churn drivers and build predictive models to support data-driven retention strategies.

## Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- 7,043 customer records
- 21 features including demographic, service usage, and billing information

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using multiple visualizations
- Categorical feature encoding and feature engineering
- Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Creation of a single-page visualization dashboard summarizing churn patterns

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (~82% accuracy)
- Random Forest (~80% accuracy)

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn rates
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn
- Contract type, tenure, and billing method are strong churn indicators

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Output
- Predictive churn models
- Feature importance analysis
- Visualization dashboard for business interpretation
